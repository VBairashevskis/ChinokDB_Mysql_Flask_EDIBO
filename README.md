# ChinokDB_Mysql_Flask_EDIBO

Description:

Description:

To complete this exercise, I used:

For an example of the database is here: https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/

Try to understand the structure of the database.

After that, you need to download and install MySQL Workbench.
Where I can download workbench: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
Workbench documentation:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/

After that, you need to create a Mysql server:

!!! Make sure youre MySQL server is up and running.!!!

Convert chinook.db to my sql.db
https://www.rebasedata.com/convert-sqlite-to-mysql-online

And connect tables in the database between themselves.

You need to use IDE: PyCharm (trial 30 days), VSCode(for free), WebStorm (trial 30 days).

Make a python file.
main.py (In main.py you'll create: connector with db data to connect to MySQL, defining the Query, getting records from the table, fetching all records from the 'cursor' object, showing the data. )
app.py (In app.py , you'll create an app object, which is an instance of the Flask object. It'll act as the central configuration object for the entire application. It's used to set up pieces of the application required for extended functionality, e.g., a database connection and help with authentication)

The commands for creating "Flask" using pip: 
pip install flask 
pip install -U flask-cors
pip install mysqlclient
pip install flask-mysqldb

Download REST API Client:  Insomnia: https://insomnia.rest/ Otherwise with the live server you can only see the GET method
